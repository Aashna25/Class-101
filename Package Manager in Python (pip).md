Goal

what we learned in the last class. We learned about packages/modules in python. We used os and shutil modules in python to create a backup for our files.

Python comes with certain packages/ modules pre-installed. os and shutil were such packages which comes pre-installed when you install python.

There are many more interesting and exciting packages in python which we can install and use. To install packages in python we use a package manager. Do you remember using package managers before?

we have used package managers - npm, yarn - for installing react native libraries in our project earlier.

Python uses a package manager called "pip" Pip stands for "Pip installs packages". We will be learning how to use pip to install python packages. We will also explore some interesting python packages!`

Python is also an Object Oriented Language. You can similarly structure code using OOPs style of coding. But obviously python has a different syntax than javascript in which we have written our code in the past. Let's see if we can ask howdoi how to write class in python.

in javascript:

class student{

constructor()

{

properties

}

display()

{
